### Quick Overview

Java is a **portable** and strictly **object-oriented* progrmaming language. 
Java applications are typically compiled into **java bytecode** that run on any **Java Virtual Machine**.
Much of its syntax was derived from C and C++; but, unlike C and C++, Java gives developers fewer low-level facilities (i.e. memory management in Java is handled by the Garbage Collector: indetifies and discards object not required by the applicaiton).

**Portable**: Java is a Platform Independent Programming Language ["write once, run everywhere"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) (WORA), no need to recompile for different platforms.
This is due to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that can execute Java bytecode (Compiled Java source code).
**Object-Oriented**: Class-based and object-oriented. Object-oriented programming makes use of **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.

JDK and JRE?
JRE stands for the Java Runtime Environemnt and it includes the JVM where Java programs get executed. The JRE also includes java plugins, and libs.
JDK stands for the Java Development Kit which is a software development kit to get you started coding. It includes the JRE, the Java compiler, tools, and libs that you need to develop and execute Java application.


### Quick diffs and sims of Java and C++
C++
1. Explicit memory management through destructors
2. Pointers, Templates, Functions have pointers
3. Multiple Inheritance
